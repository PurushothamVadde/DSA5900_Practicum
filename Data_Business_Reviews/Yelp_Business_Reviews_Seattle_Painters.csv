He & his wife were a pleasure to work with. Always on time & on budget. He was very flexible with us changing our mind with colors and even offered his advice. His quality of work is amazing, everything was taped and lines were clean. He did an inspection with me to go over any issues and they cleaned up the place great. I've recommend him to my friends as well. I'll be hiring him in the future for any painting needs.",4/24/2018,0,0,0,0,Null,Null,Null,0
