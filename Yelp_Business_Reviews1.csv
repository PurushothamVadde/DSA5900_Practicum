So, Yelp is the only place I know to reach out.    First time we called, the call went to an answering machine. We had an ice storm, assumed a lot of people were impacted. So, we agreed to the two week timeline, David gave us, before they could come visit.   David was professional, but not thorough enough. We ended up having the same issue we described to him, two days later. When he came, he turned on the ran water to appear thorough. He recognized the ""shower clogging"" and ""possible backup"". He talked about what he could do for us,  but didn't offer to unclog the shower or back yard piping.   Two days layer the issue became urgent with the backup problem David had described, ending with 3 inoperable  bathrooms.   I called the next morning at 8AM, left a message. I gave it an hour and half, understanding people get busy, and called again around 9:30, explaining the urgency on the message.    Then due to urgency and no returned call, had to call another plumbing company.   Liszeski Plumbing turned what could have been fixed in one day, into two weeks waiting and no fix. We are disappointed no phone call was returned.   We have our issue fixed, a new plumbing company to use, and still no call back from Liszeski Plumbing.  When someone comes into your home and spends time talking how they want to build a relationship and have your long term business, you feel like it's good customer care. When you find it was just talking, no action, and your money has been taken--especially with no returned call---you feel defrauded.    We understand paying for their time and why there are service fees. But with what the new plumber found today, there is no way this happened within a two day time frame. It definitely was symptoms from the first flooding we experienced two weeks ago, and then again today. Which means the two week waiting Liszeski Plumbing gave us, plus no onsite offer to do more discovery or options to fix, or even an offer to call back in check in---we ended up having a bigger issue than we would have had originally.    All of this could have been prevented with a call back. We would have been happy to pay David more money today to fix the issue, hoping he'd be honest enough to honor the $89.50 he already charged us. We're ~$400 out of pocket expense, PLUS the $89.50 from Liszeski Plumbing and wondering how much cheaper it would have been if they fixed it two weeks ago, or the day they came.

We initially found them on Angie's List after shopping around with several other plumbing companies. One fateful July afternoon I looked up at the ceiling on our downstairs bathroom to see cracks with dripping water. Never a good sign. My husband ""popped"" the ceiling to reveal a gush of water and moldy drywall. Second bad sign. We knew then that this was going to be no small task. The first plumbing company charged us $100 to reset the upstairs toilet. That did not fix the problem. The second company said that we would need to replace a section of the pipes that had been rusted out and had holes; they quoted us almost $1000. The next few companies had the same consensus. We called Cherokee for a quote and although they weren't the cheapest their professionalism landed them the job. Their owner, Colin, came out to evaluate our situation and give us a quote. He took the time to show me and my husband everything that he was seeing and explained the ins and out. His demeanor and clear competence made him easy to trust. The determination was that we needed to replace all of our vintage cast iron, circa 1937, plumbing. Although we could patch the original plumbing it would only buy us time, and did we really want to have to re-do the drywall, etc. again in a few months or years? The diagnosis and price tag was not pretty, but it was a much easier pill to swallow after being included in the process. Colin told my husband the prep work that he could do himself to cut down on costs. While the work was expensive we never once felt taken advantage of or price gauged. Colin did a great job at keeping us in the loop and enabled us to make as many choices as possible, such as what type of pipe material to use. He had a detailed contract outlining the work and a very pleasant secretary, Mary, to work with and answer any questions we had. Even though I could call his office I never once felt like I was imposing if I called his cell phone because he was always so personable. Once we got the job scheduled it took them about 4 days to replace all the plumbing. We weren't able to stay at our house during that time due to the water being off, but I trusted Colin with our house key and he never once gave me a reason to doubt him. He did an excellent job calling us at the end of the day to discuss the progress and even asked us to meet him a few times to show us some concerns he had and get our input. After working with several other contractors after him to get our bathroom put back together I can tell you what a rare, but much appreciated, thing that is. It is difficult to be put in an emergency situation like ours and to feel powerless, but Colin did the best possible job to ease our anxiety and help us feel empowered. It was so nice to know exactly what was going on and to realize that he valued our time and business. He left our house cleaner than it was when he arrived. His workers meticulously put up sheeting to stop dust from spreading, laid down paper to protect our floors, and cleaned up after themselves every day. Quite the anomaly for contractors! Most importantly is that our plumbing works! We have not had a single problem since he finished at our house. I wish all companies could be as professional and courteous as Cherokee Plumbing. They get the job done right and are customer oriented. They have our business for life.",5/18/2015,1,4,0,4,,,,0

Anna, who answers the phone, was very nice.I just am not up to playing plumber games, where they say they'll be out at a specific time, and then they aren't. They don't call when they are actually on the way, and they show up after you've called to reschedule because it's after the latest time they said they'd be here, and you're now into overtime pay - and with no face mask in these covid times.I can't deal with having to take **multiple days** off from work - and possibly losing my job - over a broken pipe.I especially can't deal with the modern practice of plumbers sending someone out to do an ""estimate"", but not to fix anything, and then scheduling an appointment to come out and do the work - forcing the customer to take off multiple times from work. That's just so wrong. I hope this was an aberration and not a common practice with Giesbrecht.What happened to: call the plumber, the plumber comes out and DOES THE WORK and gives you a bill and you pay? Done and done? ONE day off from work, one day of stress and anxiety and fear, and it's over?I'm sure the Giesbrechts are wonderful people. I'm also fairly sure they are good plumbers.I just can't deal with being stood up. I won't get any more time off from work until late MAY. So I guess I will have to live without water for all of March and April, and most (or maybe even all) of May.But don't let my anxieties and stress reflect on them. It's a bad time all around. They're doing their best, and I'm a hot mess, without water.",3/2/2021,0,1,0,0,,,,0

I had used Magic Plumbing the last time this happened (a year ago, actually). Like then, so this time Magic Plumbing arrived in timely fashion and had the clog out very quickly. Job well done (and *very* reasonably priced). But wait! There's more. Later that night I noticed that my water heater was dripping enough to make me think there was a problem. I called (after hours) and Rod called me back. He gave me some tips on what to check. I followed his instructions and I found where the water was coming from. I called him back to tell him what I found, and he diagnosed it over the phone and told me how to fix it myself! Now, I am generally a DIY'er, so I was quite pleased with that. Here's the thing: he didn't make anything up, he was confident that I could actually take care of the problem, and he offered to come fix it in the event that I am not able to. This guy is not only a plumbing pro, he is a very nice person who, it seems, genuinely wants to help people without gouging them for cash. They pretty much had my business with reasonable prices, but because of their excellence in customer service (esp. Rod who was very patient with me), they now have my loyalty.

Smith 50 gallon, 9 year warranty water tank for $565 because I did not want the brand Pipe Doctors used, Bradford White.  Same brand that was leaking.  Once Cody arrived he asked about the one I purchased and asked if I wanted that one installed.  He also explained he had never had a Bradford White that leaked, same thing several plumbers told me.  Anyway I asked him to price the installation of mine and then price what I would pay if he acquired one from his wholesaler, Locke Supply, and he installed the Bradford White from them.  Cody went to his truck and in about 10 minutes came back and stated he could sell me a Bradford White 50 gallon, 6 year warranty tank for $1089, and could install it for $1450 total cost.  That tank would have been less than $500 ANYWHERE else.  Seemed high to me for a lower warranty tank so I asked for just the labor charges for my tank.  IT WAS $1050 TO INSTALL MY TANK.  He jumped the labor charges by 2 1/2 times because I had my own tank.  Seems shady and it seemed they were hell bent on charging me $1,000+Now you may ask yourself why would I even do business with someone like this.  Because I had already missed 2 days of work and would have to find another plumber and miss more work, too costly.Well, another glitch, I stated I had my own tank and it was too large in diameter for the opening by 2"" so I had to return that tank and since Lowe's did not have a ""slim"" I had to go with the Bradford White.Now don't get me wrong, the work was quality.  But how do you charge someone less than $400 to install one if you buy their overpriced tank but charge almost the price you are selling that overpriced tank for the labor to put in my tank.I think the company is shady when it comes to emergencies.  I cannot even say they are a good company since they take advantage of someone during an emergency.  I had much more work to do at my house and even told Cody at the beginning, BEFORE he overpriced me that I would use them for all of it if they were affordable or even reasonable.  Needless to say they were neither.   I even asked about the 10% senior discount and all that was deducted was $25 from an Internet coupon.Again, the work was quality but I think they are not an honest company.Good Luck of you use them.",3/15/2018,0,6,1,0,,,,0

I wish I had paid more attention to the other reviews about their predatory charges and billing methods and to find out that the plumbers they send are not always licensed plumbers. I called Pipe Doctors out to give an estimate on several jobs I needed, one of which included replacing a couple fittings on the main trunk from the home. The guy that came out quoted this specific part of the repairs at $1200 because he was unsure how much had to be replaced. They also wanted a deposit of $1200 to secure the job, this seemed high priced and odd to me but I unfortunately signed the quote thinking this was an estimate as most places do and with there being several other items I needed done I thought maybe it was just itemized this way as a package price or something. After the job the plumber called and said that the job was $699 and he needed to run my card again because they could not take it out of the deposit. Some other issues came up with our bathroom and we needed to hire out a general contractor instead so I wanted to get a refund on our deposit of $1200. The manager called me back 3 days later and told me that even though the technician that did the job billed it at $699, I agreed to pay more so that is what they are taking. So after this was completed I paid $1200 for 1 90 degree fitting and 1 45 degree fitting to be replaced, this took less than 3 hours to do. These guys charged me over $400/per hour for this job, more than double the average per hour cost of a plumber!

I had a broken/frozen pipe outside, and he was fairly quick to respond after contacting him. He charged $150 just to come out and look at the broken pipe and then changed me $475 on top of that to change out two simple PVC pipes (couldn't use more than $10 in parts). Total time at my house was no more than 45 mins, and charged me over $600. The next day I went outside to put a heating tape on the newly ""fixed"" pipe and noticed a small leak around the same area that he claimed was ""fixed"", so I called him back and he told me he would see what he can do about sending someone out that day... I could tell I wasn't a priority on his list because I hadn't heard back from him in over 3 hours so I decided to call him back and get a status, and he told me that it was going to have to wait until tomorrow at 9am.... After a bit of arguing, I told him to call when he arrived since no one will be at the house when he arrives since we both work during the day. He finally called me at 1100 (2 hours late) and told me that he missed a crack in the copper fitting and it would be an additional $250 to fix it. I told him to pound sand and put everything back together. I called another plumber and came and fixed his mistake for $150 total (included $100 brass fitting). Bottom line, this guy is a major price gouger and doesn't do good work in the long run. Go with someone else.

1,All Care Plumbing Services,"12817 S Luther RdOklahoma City, OK 74857",2,5,,Open 24 hours,,Malena O.,0,1,0,No,0,5,"Wednesday night I walked into my youngest daughter's room and heard a strange noise. I pinpointed it to the wall, close to the house exterior, that runs between my daughter's rooms. It sounded like running water in the wall. The outside faucet runs right into this space, so I went outside, but there was no leaking water. I felt the walls and the carpet, but nothing was wet. I called my mom, my go-to Miss Fix It, and she said we'd look at it. Yesterday, I walked into my oldest daughter's room and it had a very musty smell. I checked my mail and the water bill was in it. My water bill was over double the usual, so I called the water company and they told me my water was running 24/7 so either my toilets were running or I had a leak somewhere. That's when I panicked and called my mom again. She said to shut the water main off and we would have to cut into the sheetrock to find the leak. I marked the studs with my heavy duty magnets and my mom came over and cut the sheetrock. The bottom of the insulation was damp, but when I turned the water back on, the leak was below the area; it was a slab leak.  I had to keep the water turned off while my mom and I received multiple plumber recommendations. I walked into my oldest's room this morning and the smell was gone.  My mom called me and told me Justin, owner and operator of All Care Plumbing, was coming by to quote me. In the meantime, I called other recommendations, but they were currently busy or I left a message.  Trades, such as plumbing and electric, are in high demand, in case you didn't know.  Justin was at my house within the hour. He was very professional and gave me a straightforward, honest answer. It was difficult to quote because no one could be 100% sure where the leak was or any damage caused until he could see, but he thought the leak was also where we thought it was. His charge is $95 an hour plus parts, regardless of it being a slab leak, which is HUGE considering many might charge me upwards of $500, at a minimum, by the mention of slab leak. I told him I was getting other quotes, which he also encouraged me to do. He left and I called my mom again to get her opinion. I hadn't heard back from anyone else yet, it's Friday, I wanted to take a shower, Justin said he could do it today or first thing in the morning and I got good vibes from him (you know me ). Mom and I agreed to call him back. He had a couple other jobs to do, but was back within 2 hours. He was able to make a relatively small hole in the concrete, found the 2 LEAKS in my tubing right where we thought it was, replaced the tubing, replaced my outside faucet upon asking (it's given me problems before and he was already right there in the wall) and poured the concrete to fix the floor. All within 2 HOURS! I'll mention he also had a helper who was also very professional and polite, but I didn't catch his name. The entire slab leak fix cost $260.....yes, you read that right. I am SO grateful for All Care Plumbing, not to mention for my mom.  I HIGHLY recommend this company for any plumbing needs that may arise! When I get my real estate license, this company will be my go-to for plumbing. Thank you Justin and company!",7/12/2019,First,0,0,0,,,,0

I thought we had a pipe leaking in the wall (it turned out to be something different) and after going over my details briefly she just flat out said ""I don't have anybody to help you with that"". Their website lists plumbing and leak detection, this didn't seem to be outside the scope of a normal plumbing job. I was kind of at a loss for words, it was bizarre. No explanation, no reason given just ""we can't do it"". Then she hung up. Tried calling back for a little clarification, went to voicemail. Didn't bother with a message and won't bother calling them again. It's pretty lousy because I believe the people actually doing the work are very good, like I said this was the first place I called.

Repairman said that the control board was bad and that it would need to be replaced. He then spent most of his time trying to convince me to replace the whole system, rather than fixing it. Our system isn't new, but it isn't exactly old and falling apart, either. We've had very few issues with it but he didn't want to hear this at all. Despite my repeatedly stating that this was the only major problem we've had and finally stating that a new system was just not going to be in our budget for at least a few more years, he continued to fearmonger that it was probably not just the control board and that we really need to just replace the whole system. What he based this on, I have no idea. We agreed to just do the control board replacement and were given a quote of over $600. The reason for this price, we were told, was the high cost of the part. I did a quick search on my own and found a brand new control board for $50 on Amazon from a 5-star marketplace seller. I then declined service from Airco, paid for the estimate and resolved to fix the furnace myself. We ended up installing the part ourselves in a little under 30 minutes and now the system is working perfectly, with no other issues at all. Total cost - $79 for the diagnosis, $50 for the part, 30 minutes of effort. Unbelievable that anyone would think it acceptable to charge over $600 for that service. I realize the cost of labor is high, but come on!Never, ever, ever calling this company again. They are far more interested in selling new systems than in servicing older ones. For the record - our heating system is 16 years old and is a model that typically lasts 20-30 years, with proper maintenance, which ours gets.Update: Austin from AirCo called me after seeing this review to attempt to harass me into taking this review down.

You declined to have a service plumber come out and instead requested our estimator to come to look at the leak as part of the free estimate on the Hot Water Tank. He determined that the leak was not coming from the Hot Water Tank, but instead was coming from the pressure relief drain that connects to the Hot Water Tank. He found the pressure relief valve went off and dumped the water into that drain causing the drain to back up. At your request, our estimator emailed you a quote to replace the Hot Water Tank. The Hot Water Tank estimate was free, and we did not charge you for coming out to inspect the leak. When a customer requests an estimate for replacing a Hot Water Tank, we send out an estimator.

Leaving us screwed because everything else around us closed as 5. If they couldn't do that job they should have said so. We could have gotten some one else. There was no reason to screw us around and cause us to be stuck with this issue. No one should be forced to pay after hour prices for a job that was agreed on to be done during hours if they are not the reason it could not be done during those hours.,3/5/2021,0,0,0,0,,,,0

Think about that for a second.I, like many others, spent about 15 minutes with a technician before I was told I would need a part that costed several thousand dollars to fix my 2 year old air conditioner. Or I was offered a leasing/service contract and because supposedly according to the technician's professional opinion the rest of my unit would likely fail within a year and I should just replace the whole unit under their advantage program, with some lofty service guarantees. I did, unfortunately.The technicians whom visited my home broke something, I caught them on camera. They tried to cover it up to make it look like it never happened, then lied and did not want to take responsibility. Eventually they did replace the item, some two weeks later. I had an issue with the installation of the duct work and had to call several times before I could get someone to come back out and get the a/c to an operational condition. When someone did come to repair the duct work they tried to say they weren't responsible for most the duct work, although their team clearly was. They took an extra 2-3 hours to fix this, although they ""weren't responsible"". This was also about two weeks later.I asked to cancel my agreement and pay for the unit; they agreed and said they were waiting on legal to draft the papers. Fast forward 10 months, I have been receiving threatening letters the entire time stating that they would send me to collections if I didn't pay them for a maintenance contract that was in the process of being terminated, all the while never giving me a new contract to sign to pay them for the unit.

These people are terrible to deal with. I am writing to you today to lodge a complaint against Roto-Rooter of Norman, OK. I have been utterly mortified at the treatment I've received at their hands. A resident of this city for ten years, I called on them today to effect a couple of plumbing repairs in my house, to wit: a clogged shower in one bathroom and a running toilet in the other bathroom.  I was not here when the technician arrived, but he explained to me that his charge was $124/hour + parts. Earlier he had told my wife that both jobs would take less than an hour.A hair ball removal corrected the clogged shower. That took about ten minutes. He had to go out for parts to basically rebuild the innards of the toilet that was running. There is a plumbing supply place about 2 miles from my house on Hwy 9 W & 24th in Norman. The technician took 50 minutes to return with the parts--he did not go to where we suggested, he said--and about 10 minutes to fix the toilet.Then he presented me with a bill--on a tablet screen, not on paper--for $306. I requested an itemized receipt for the parts and a written receipt for the work and was informed that it would be emailed the bill after I paid it. This was not satisfactory to me; I wanted to see what parts were purchased and what they cost, not to mention the charges for the work.  I have never heard of being unable to receive a written invoice for work or a bona fide receipt for purchased parts. So I refused to pay the bill until I could be provided the documents I requested. Thereupon I was forced to endure rude argument from this technician for about ten minutes after repeatedly telling him I did not intend to argue. Eventually I asked him to leave my property.That's chapter 1. It gets worse. I immediately called Roto Rooter of Norman and requested to speak with a supervisor about this and subsequently spoke with a man named ""Dan."" No further information on his name was forthcoming. I will make a long story short. I was totally rebuffed in any attempt I made to explain my position on the propriety of a written receipt. I was repeatedly told that I had to pay the bill first. This man raised his voice to me more than several times, would not let me speak, raised irrelevant matters about what I do for a living, told me that my bill was now over $400, that I would be charged for another hour of his technician's time. I thought this was ludicrous and wondered to myself just how anyone could behave so irresponsibly. I repeatedly emphasized that I was not trying to get out of paying the bill, that I would be happy to pay it when I had an itemized invoice. Instead I was told several times rudely and in an elevated tone that I was attempting to get out of paying the bill at all. At least twice I was threatened with being turned over to ""a collector."" I offered to pay a substantial sum of good faith money to the company pending receipt of the documents I am requesting. This offer too was rudely rejected with derisive laughter, and again with the implication that I was trying to get out of paying the company altogether.I have since received a bill for $415.43 via email. It is not itemized and contains no copy of receipt for parts. The bill is accompanied by a fanciful narrative of the events by the original technician, one ""Todd R.""  This is outrageous. I have never been so abused by a business in all my life. I have never ever been spoken to in such a discourteous manner by someone supposedly holding a responsible position with a responsible company. My credit rating going back 40+ years is exemplary. I served for 25 years as an ordained clergyman (deacon) in the Catholic Church. I am prepared to present as many character witnesses as necessary to attest to my honesty and truthfulness. And I'm prepared, since I have been threatened, to defend myself legally should that become necessary.That I should find it necessary to contact you over such a seemingly trivial matter as this is indeed indicative of the state we have gotten to in this country: where a supposedly reputable business can treat a customer so shabbily with the expectation of complete impunity. Rest assured that I will make it known to my many friends and associates just exactly what they can expect if they have the misfortune to do business with Roto Rooter of Norman.

He came out and did the job. Fast forward to last week- our AC has been acting up and after repairing some parts, it still wasn't keeping up right. The heat and air guy came out and looked around and asked if someone had done any work on our fireplace. We said yes last March. He informed us that whoever had called the gas line, also cut a hole in our plenum. So our AC has been sucking in hot attic air and trying to cool it. We called edco plumbing and the woman who answered the phone was extremely rude and condescending, saying that they would never cut into a plenum. Due to the location of the gas line they capped, and the hole in the plenum, it's pretty obvious that it was done. We emailed them photos and asked for an explanation. None was given. We asked them to just come out to the house and show us how they accessed the gas line without making the hole- nope. They don't have time to do that unless we want to pay a service fee. Bottom line- don't use this company. I can get over a mistake happening if he didn't realize what he did and was willing to fix it. But refusing to even come out and look? Unacceptable. Also- I considered the fact that the hole was already there when he repaired the gas line. Edco plumbing is also a heat and air company. So if the hole was already there, I would assume they would acknowledge it to the homeowner so that A) no one blames them for it and B) we know our AC will not work properly.",7/24/2019,0,0,0,0,,,,0

I didn't write a bad review on them at the time and instead decided to just not use this company again because there are many to choose from.Two years later I mentioned this fact to someone and the owner of Advent heard I had had an issue and he contacted me directly to get the details. He was extremely concerned and explained that he did have a problem employee at the time who was now no longer with the company and he did everything in his power to ensure I was a happy customer. TWO YEARS later, the owner took my complaint personally and cared enough to do whatever it took to fix it. I can say for a fact that the owner cares about his customers and his honesty and integrity cannot be impeached. He's an honest man who runs an honest business and he puts his customers' satisfaction even before company profits.I know I can trust this company with my HVAC and plumbing needs. I am fully confident that Advent does great work at the fairest price possible and they put their customers first.",7/21/2019,0,0,0,0,,,,0

Every time had been a disappointment. They almost hold a monopoly in the Newalla area because they are a larger company and able to make quick calls. They are rude and money hungry. Our first time dealing with them was for busted plumbing in the middle of a freeze. It took the guy 5 mins to fix it but it cost over $200. I learned to do simple plumbing myself just so I wouldn't go broke trying to get any help from them. The second time was last summer '16. Our AC died on the hottest day in august. They came out, said they don't make the freon that our AC required anymore. Said it was illegal for them to even touch it and it needed to be replaced. They could do it that day but we needed to have check in hand by the end of the job. It was over 6k and they wanted to charge another financing fee of $300. We went through our bank to finance it. Now to current day. Our brand new AC doesn't work. They told my husband that if we don't have thier money grubbing company come check it beginning of summer and beginning of winter, we void our warranty. It's $50 everytime they come out. We called them because our brand new AC quit working exactly a yr after install. It just blows hot air. Rude secretary wouldn't give a quote for anything or provide any insight. The technician said he fixed it, told my husband there was a tube that need to have air pushed though to clear out the dirt in the unit. It's a 1 yr old unit. It shouldn't just quit. They charged us the $50 and the AC still doesn't work. I bet if when we have to call them back, instead of being an honest company, they will try to charge us again to do nothing.

He replaced the filters and also offered to clean out the outside condenser and service the machine for a small extra fee. I obliged and asked him to go ahead and do a routine maintenance.

Our unit stopped working a couple days later so I called them again and they had someone out within the hour which I greatly appreciated. However, this technician told me he thought we probably had a freon leak and that with our a/c's age we should consider getting it replaced as it would cost us 700-1000 to get the leak addressed and there was no guarantee that was the problem. I did appreciate the helpfulness and friendliness of both technicians however with an expense as large as this I called a different company for a second opinion. We had a different company come out who explained to me that the unit had frozen up because there was a piece of insulation that had fallen on top of the coils causing it to freeze up, he also said that the freon was a lb low. They fixed that and inspected the outside unit that had supposedly been cleaned out by Norman Heat and Air, I witnessed them pulling chunks of dirt and junk out of the unit. It had not been cleaned out. They had the unit up and working within the hour and it has been working better than it has since we moved in two years ago.

When I originally called to get a quote for the cost of repair to one of the windowsills in my home, Baxton Reinkes of Reinkes Total Home Services came to my home and seemed pretty personable.  We'd got to talking and I told Baxton that I'd recently moved to OK and purchased my home.  Baxton began telling me that the damage to my windowsill was due to water entering through the window. Baxton proceeded to ask if he could inspect other windows in my home. I escorted Baxton and another serviceman that came with him around my home showing them all the windows.  Baxton pointed out water damage to other windowsills within my home and asked if the home inspector I hired had informed me about any of it.  I stated, ""he did not.""  Baxton stated that he should have and that if he didn't, he is liable.  I asked Baxton if he was certain, to which he stated, ""absolutely, I used to be a home inspector.  It's our job to catch those things so that we can inform the buyer and they can negotiate a lower price.""  Baxton informed me that I should contact the Construction Industries Board (CIB) and file a complaint and stated that I shouldn't have to pay for this, before stating that he would certainly appreciate my business in moving forward with making repairs on my windows.  It made perfect sense to me, therefore, I proceeded to file a complaint with CIB. Fast forward a month, CIB contacted me asking for my corroborating statements.  The problem is that now, upon contacting Baxton for his statement, he is nowhere to be found.  For nearly 3 weeks, I called and texted every number Baxton provided, and also emailed him.  However, I never received a response.  I'm sure I look like a con to CIB now, and they will likely not conclude their investigation in my favor. On a professional note, flaking shows a poor work ethic, an unprofessional demeanor and is simply bad for business.  On a personal note, I think it's shameful to treat a fellow veteran this way.  I'm disappointed, but lesson learned...  Thanks, Baxton...for nothing!",7/18/2018,0,1,0,0,,,,0

I felt obligated to leave a review this time though. Bottom line up front: $129/hr for a plumber and helper and the person that answers the phone back at the shop is rude as hell.I had a water main bust in my home after the cold freeze at the beginning of Jan. Water was pouring out of my ceilings, not a pretty site. I called around to a few people to try getting somebody to come out, city plumbing said they couldn't make it until the next day. As this was the soonest I could find, I took it. They showed up at my door 5 hrs later. Good on them.I showed them the leak and asked if they could fix it. They agreed and off they went. The plumber, Todd, was a great friendly guy. He talked me through it all and gave pointers on how to prevent similar situation from happening. They ended up not having the correct glue, so they had to make a store run. They finish the job in about 3 hrs and then we do a water check. Still leaking. They work at it some more, do another water check, still leaking. Finally, they said ""we don't have all the parts to complete the project, so we would have to run to the store again and then we will be charging overtime"". I passed on the overtime charges, they said ""but we will get you hot water before we leave"". An hour, I have hot water with a slow drip. They put a bucket under and said we will be back first thing in the morning, around 9. They leave, I turn on the hot water tank and it starts spraying water out of the connections. I turned it off and made it without hot water.The next morning around 10 they show up to tackle it again. They can't get the shark bite to connect because the floor joist is in their way. They keep connecting, checking, leaks, them retry. 2hrs later, they said they needed to run back to the shop to get the correct tools. My girlfriend asks me if they have tried using the access panel behind the dryer that she told them about the previous day. I chase them down in the driveway and ask them about the panel, and they said ""oh yeah, I remember being told that yesterday"". 30 minutes later, everything is fixed. They gather all of their tools and start writing up the invoice. I was guessing a $100 service call, $400 for fixing the broken lines (total broken - 2ft), but then I get a bill for over a $1,000. Parts were $130. The rest, labor! I paid the plumbers because I knew they had to charge what they had to charge, I figured I would speak to the office about maybe reducing the bill since there was a store run, hrs spent to get hot water that didn't work, having to rework the same issue multiple times.My girlfriend is the nicest lady you meet, so I figured she would be the best person to speak with them. The gentleman at the office treated her like chopped liver. She said he treated her like a dumb rich girl, making rude replies and telling her to quit repeating herself. His main argument was the plumber didn't charge us for all of the parts he used and he didn't sum up the hrs properly so we were already receiving a discount. To rerun the plumbing in a few rooms deserved a price tag like that, not just 2 ft of broken of line in the ceiling.To sum it up, Todd is a nice plumber, has some things to work on, but City plumbing is expensive and needs to work on customer relations.",1/17/2017,0,1,0,0,Business Owner,1/17/2018,Adam my name is Terry Sorrells I am the new owner of City plumbing .  I read your review and i understand why you were unhappy with the back and forth without resolving your plumbing issue. .  I hope you would reconsider and give us the opportunity as new owner to win your business back sir.   You can call me at 405 354 1150 thanks again for being a City Plumbing customer Terry Sorrells,1

When they first called me they said they were going to come out the next day (01/16/2020) so I call them and the man on the phone was so rude and said nope they will be out the following day (01/17/2020) and I said why is that, when you spoke with me on the phone you said you would be out today (01/16/2020). And the man said that was never ever agreed on and I said are you kidding me? I literally remember talking on the phone and you told me that y'all would be out today (01/16/2020)!!! Then he tried to say that we talked on the phone earlier today (01/16/2020) and we agreed on tomorrow (01/17/2020) and I said we have NOT spoke on the phone once today!!! I have been waiting on a phone call all day, I even called you today (01/16/2020) at 2:05pm and no one answered my call!! He then ""remembered"" that we spoke on the phone yesterday (01/15/2020) and that's when he told me tomorrow (01/16/2020). Then he went on to say that we missed our appointment and that they called us several times and knocked on our door! I believe that they came to the door because they ""tagged it"" and he saw our cameras but I do not believe he knocked on our door or called us because we were home all day!! And I have ZERO missed calls from anyone from that company and I even tried to call them!!!!! I believe he showed up and ""tagged"" our door so he could collect his $75 service fee and then left without trying to call or enter the home!

From the beginning it was kind of a hassle getting on the schedule and they only had availability a week in advance. Which I get if you don't have much staff so I was willing to let that one go. The receptionist told me I would get a 30 min warning before the plumber got to my house on the day of my appointment since my time slot was 4-5 hours. Luckily, I was already home because he did not call ahead of time. Once he ran the water and flushed the toilet a few times he went out to inspect the cleanouts. He told me he would have to get on the roof to clean it out because I didn't have ground clean outs and the home warranty didn't cover that. I mentioned that I did have ground cleanouts and he said, ""oh, I didn't see them."" So he cleaned that out and we went back in to see that the toilet was still leaking into the closet behind the toilet and the tub wasn't draining properly. He said he would have to put me back on the schedule for a scope of the pipe and then they would have to do concrete slab work to repair the pipe. He informed me that they would have to call the Home Warranty company because they probably wouldn't cover it and he would let me know what they say.He didn't call back so I called ALD the following week and they informed me it would be $1,600 out of my own pocket as well as the hundreds of dollars that the Home Warranty company had to pay. I called another plumber (Hull Plumbing) to get a second opinion. They snaked the cleanout from the roof ($313) and replaced the wax ring seal ($157) within an hour. It's working great now. Don't waste your time with this company even if they are assigned to you by your Home Warranty company. Take the cash payout and find a reputable plumber.

Below is the exact quote from a year ago when I requested the cost to clear a simple clogged bathtub drain (which another company did for much less and without special equipment). ""It's very simple. $155 per hour plus $75 for each additional drop. If you feel we shouldn't charge for each additional tool we take off the truck, I'd suggest going ahead and spending a couple thousand for a drain machine. That way you wouldn't have to pay someone to do the work  I have $100,000 in equipment plus overhead sitting in your driveway. I have to make a profit or it's not worth my effort.""",10/6/2019,0,1,0,1,Business Owner,10/8/2019,"Your clarification makes everything more clear for me.  You are not a customer of our company.  You simply called in for a quote over the phone and never once used our service.  Now, you've discovered that Yelp allows you to bellyache about everyone who ever did you wrong without any recourse.  I stand by the statement you quoted.  Every single time my truck pulls into your driveway, there sits over $100,000 in tools and equipment plus well over $5,000,000 worth of insurance plus the cost of the men running the truck.  That is why we must charge $155 per hour for drain cleans plus $79 for each additional drain.  We simply cannot and do not intend to waste an entire day at your house doing ""since you're here"" work for $50.  No reputable company would.  Our product is our time and skill and time is money that we use to pay employees and pay our bills as well.  That is not an exaggeration.  What is an exaggeration is your assertion that we did you wrong by giving you a price you didn't like.  I understand that you don't intend to hire anyone who charges a reasonable rate so that he or she can provide detail oriented quality work.  If we cannot perform quality work that we can stand behind, we prefer not to do the work at all.  It's that simple.  In order to perform quality work that we can stand behind, we must charge a reasonable rate, not cut rates that don't even allow us to break even, let alone provide a quality product.  There are plenty of cut rate plumbers out there who are desperate enough to pay you to work on your home.  I fix these guys' work all the time and hear from clients how they changed their name and cannot be found after causing several thousand dollars in damage that they can't afford to fix.  As someone who admittedly never used our company and admittedly is not a customer of ours, your bellyaching over a price you felt was too expensive offers nothing to the conversation about the quality of our work or the reputation of our company.  All it does is demonstrate what you've already admitted. You're a cheapskate that places no value on quality or other people's time and work.  Instead you have no life so you choose to spend your time on the Internet complaining that everyone who doesn't let you have your way did you wrong simply because they were honest with you and said something you did not like.  That's a reflection on you, not us.  I'm very happy that you found someone who fits into your world view.  I'm also very happy that it wasn't us because our company would never be a good fit for you and you would never be a good fit for our company.  Stop trying to be a victim and get a life. You’ll be much happier and so will everyone else who meets you.",1

I also came surprisingly close to ending my marriage when we replaced a garbage disposal ourselves. Knowing these things, I determined that the best way to keep things moving from a plumbing perspective (along with some other things) was to call a professional.Since ""doing what Julie suggests"" is one of those general principles you can successfully apply to resolve most problems,^ I contacted these folks (through Yelp, no less!) for help. They got right back to me, explained how busy they were and their current hours, and were kind enough to recommend some other people to me.But I would not be so easily pawned off a non-endorsed plumber, so when I came back with a proposed appointment on an upcoming day off, we worked it out. They were exactly what you want - friendly and competent. All problems were fixed, I learned a bit to avoid shelling out unnecessary cash in the future, and the pipes are piping away as they should.There's really no contest. Use these guys.* Yes, I am blaming the dog for the plumbing problem. That is what the dog is for. If I didn't have a dog, I would have to admit that a certain amount of the blame for any plumbing issues might lie with my ancestors, who apparently lived lives of Arctic luxury since they were the only people up there who didn't have to hunt anything, insofar as their genes supported self-grown fur coats; and I don't want to do that (by ""that,"" I mean admit it, which you'll recall was the conditional at the beginning of this disturbingly long sentence, a length only exacerbated by this explanation).

On a hunch, he checked, and turned out enough water had collected in the exhaust to keep a relay sensor from functioning properly and that kept the unit from turning on. Nothing was actually wrong with our unit, it was the ducting in the attic! He went to the local hardware store, picked up supplies and replaced the ducting and it has worked perfectly ever since. Mike credited his hunch to a one time event when he learned the business that had been similar.

No invoice was created. All the 'licensed plumber' did was remove the vacuum breaker and tell my husband he had to check with his boss... several times. Unfortunately he was obviously not experienced enough to be on a call by himself. He never offered any options other than completely replacing the spigot.

After his 'evaluation' he determined it would be either $300+ or IF he needed to go under the house it would be $500+. That was way to expensive for us so we decided to wait on 'repairs'. He left the old vacuum breaker on the ground so we went to Locke Supply and bought one for less than $30. That was all that it needed. Not sure how that became such an expensive solution in his eyes.

Usually, if the faucet shows signs of wear or other problems we will suggest replacing the whole unit with a 1-year warranty.

The next day after the job was complete I had a small back up from my washing machine at the other end of the house. I again called Herman's they sent a man out who said that because it was not still running it must be my washer -call appliance repair. I did and they determined that it was not the machine. I call Herman's back and the man came out and ran a cable down the drain from the roof, he said that the line was blocked and said we needed to send a camera down, the next day the camera crew came out and even though all the other drains in the area were fine they said they would have to dig up my kitchen floor they could not tell me what the blockage was they said they could not see  and assumed the pipe had failed, when ask about price they said they would have to get back to me. Now I had just spent $3,000.00 with them for the slab leak and these two calls for the slow drain(Fri at Noon) by the following Tues I had not heard anything. I called another plumber and he directed his attention to the drain I told him about, He cleaned the drain out put in a clean out (at my direction) and was gone.  I have still not heard from Herman's, to say I am disappointed would understate, Herman's was in the past a good company, but if this is the regular treatment they give to they're customers that time is gone.",2/19/2020,0,1,1,0,,,,0

I called Brandon's plumbing to have them come out and repair it. My appointment was set at 4:30 pm a that day. Starting at about 5:30 I started to call their dispatch to get an eta. They kept on giving me the runaround on when they would be here. Every time I talked to them they told me a tech was in route and it would be about 45 minutes. They finally showed up at 10:30 pm. The tech came in and did a quick diagnosis and said we were leaking sewage and had a lake of poo under the house. Of course that late at night they weren't able to do anything about it. I was told i would get a call Monday to schedule the repairs to the tune of $2200 plus the service call charges I paid that night. They charged me an extra $150.00 to come out after hours and didn't even advise me of that extra charge till the tech was asking for payment Saturday night. Fast forward till Monday I had to call them due to no phone call. I told the tech it needed to be done Monday or Tuesday due to work schedule and the fact we have raw sewage leaking into the house. They set me up for Tuesday to come and do the work inside and later in the week to do the outside work. I wasn't happy but agreed. I get a phone call this morning they canceled today.

I could stand in their office and walk back into what looked like their accounting area and roam around for several minutes. I left after waiting for about 15-20 mins and no contact. Plus some of their employees visibly showed disgust when they were required to remove their shoes to enter one of my tenants house. Pretty bad customer service and disrespectful of my foreign tenants. Now the reason for this review. Some of my tenants had toilets backed up. I couldn't find a plumber that could service them that day so they looked around. Said they found a plumber that could make it that day. I didn't think about asking who the plumber was. When it was done, I was told the cost was $240 because they had to snake the toilets and sewer line. That's a first for me. I wondered who they used and they said Brandon's Plumbing. Furthermore, apparently they said the toilet paper was too thick causing the problem. The tenants use Charmin. I've never had a problem with Charmin and never heard of toilet paper being too thick causing backups. That was about a week or two ago. Now they called me today because the lines are clogged again. Brandon's invoice pointed to a flapper possibly causing the back up, and specifically said they wouldn't warranty their work. How convenient to not fix the actual cause of the problem. I'll be sure none of my tenants use their services again. I gave them 2 stars because they were available and responded quickly.",4/20/2019,0,2,0,0,,,,0

About a month later noticed a pretty bad sewage smell through the AC. My landlord had HVAC come out and they recommended a plumber come first because the crawl space was completely filled with water. My landlord called Grooms plumbing and they sent out Ron or Ronnie was his name. The guy came the first time, unclogged the main line, cleaned out the overflow and left all of the garbage and debris on my back patio. He claimed that the excessive amount of water was coming from the bathroom drain not being installed properly, he fixed that but never got under the house to locate other leaks or problems. He recommended that my landlord get a fan and put it in the crawl space to dry out the water which would not have worked. 2 weeks went by and nothing was getting better so the plumber was dispatched back out to my residence. Over a span of 4 days he was supposed to bring a pump and pump out the water and access the pipes to ensure there was no additional leaks. He showed up late on days he did come, left equipment (shovels, box knives etc) where my 18 month old son could gain access, and didn't show up on days he was supposed to be here. My landlord ultimately told him we no longer needed his business. We hired Hull plumbing and they came right in, got right under the house, discovered that several of the pipes were detached causing sewer gas to seep into my house. They fixed the pipes and immediately the smell was gone, they cleaned up after themselves and were very kind and got the job done.

1,Homeland Plumbing,"117 Industrial BlvdMoore, OK 73160",3,3.5,,Open 24 hours,Claimed,Iran G.,5,4,0,No,0,1,"As I was preparing my tax documents I came across a bill from this company. Here is my unpleasant experience with homeland plumbing. In summer of 2018 I reached out to homeland plumbing for a minor repair of the sink in my rental property. Brian and Martin came to the house. After inspecting the sink Brian said a part should be replaced. He said his fee is $199.00. Service fee $59.00, part $15.00 and $125.00 labor for 30. minutes work. I told him the charge was too high and asked for a more reasonable flat rate. He said that was how his company charges. Despite the excessiveness of the charge since I was pressed for time, I told him to do the repair. Before he started the work he said if something breaks during the repair the charge will be higher. I asked for an approximate estimate. He refused to provide one. At that point I knew he wanted to take advantage of me- a woman with a foreign accent- and make some quick bucks. I told him nobody in the right mind accepts this kind of offer. I offered to pay him $20.00 for gas money and told them to leave. Martin went outside but Brian refused to leave. He became very angry, used vulgar language and bullied me. He threatened to put a lien on the house that has a sale sign and stop me from selling it.  Since I did not want any complication during the selling process and I was concerned about my safety, I wrote him a check for the so called service call and asked him to leave, He took the check, refused to leave and ranted about 10 more minutes and finally left. Needless to say that I was shaken by Brian's crazy behavior and left the property with a migraine headache and nausea.  After couple of days I called homeland plumbing to speak to Brian's boss and ask for refund. I spoke to Kelly. She introduced herself as the office manager. I could tell she was prepared for my call. She said Brian was the owner of the company, defended him vehemently and chastised me for offending his boss. She said Brian is an honest man and has no intention of cashing the check and continued praising the boss. I was surprised that she was idolizing her boss to that degree and asked her if she was related to Brian . She said no. I told her Brian has made the right decision not to cash the check and wished her a good day. After 5 minutes Kelly left an incomplete message on my answering machine. I called her to inquire about the call. Kelly said Brian has changed his mind. He is cashing the check and donating the money to a church youth group. I asked her the name of the church. She said I do not know. We- meaning her and Brain who are in fact married- do not attend that church!so much for Brian's honesty!  I thought the situation was too ridiculous. I told her I knew Brian was not the kind of person who would give up the money and asked her not to contact me again. I decided to post a review because I strongly believe that no business owner has the right to threaten customers, coerce them into writing him a check for the work he has not done and decide how to spend their money. As far as I am concerned he owes me an apology and a refund but he cannot make up for the stress he caused me. Doing business with him was a mistake and a disaster.",4/4/2019,0,0,1,1,,,,0

They arrived late and with no indication on their vehicles or clothing that they were with Repipe Specialists2.  The first day they did not put anything down to protect the floors or carpets.3. One of the two man crew fell through the ceiling of the front bathroom4. A poor job was done to mitigate/clean up the insulation and dirt from the attic. Final clean up after work was completed was also below average.5. The first person scheduled to perform the ceiling repair never showed up and a second person had to be scheduled6. They failed to check their work before turning the water back on.  As work went on I made periodic inspections of the work areas.  During one of these inspections I noted a union that had not been completed.  A short time later I was informed the water was going to be turned back on.  After notifying them of what I had seen they went back to the area and completed the needed work.7. In my opinion the professionalism of the work completed was below average.  They did the minimum amount of work to complete the installation of the pipe, leaving additional work to be done to properly repair the dry wall.8. Insulation of the piping in the attic was below average.  There was over 12 feet of piping found that was not properly insulated.  Most of the areas were approximately 12 inches in length.9.

Ace's Three plumber showed up Sunday morning and ran a snake down the roof vent, could not clear the problem and said he would return with a larger machine. He returned that evening with a bigger machine but still did not clear the drain and charged $135.00 saying that they would need to put a cleanout. They returned Tuesday, ran a camera and said said the would be back later with different equipment. They returned and ran a snake again and the draining was worse when they left than when they arrived. They was suppose to install a cleanout that never happened. The plumber was writing a ticket for over $800.00 and when I questioned him he called his boss and was told I was not being charged for the camera charge. I got a bill today for $450.00 for a plumbing job that was worse when they left. The total cost from Ace's $135.00 first 2 trips, $450.00 next 2 trips = $585.00.Called Herman's Plumbing, they came out Wednesday, Ran a camera, found the blockage at 90 feet, that is where Ace's had the problem, and ran a snake down the same drain to the main, 135 feet, and like magic I no longer have a plumbing problem.

I understand having a strip of mud across my back yard. I also have a couple of plastic pipes sticking up around 8"" high which are a trip hazard. Sadly, one of the original stopped up places, the toilet, is starting to make that gurgling noise that comes before it has to be snaked, and the bathroom sink has never been unclogged, so I don't use it. My biggest problem with Backwoods (my fault for not getting another estimate) is that it cost $10,000. Bryce did tell me that if pipes had to be replaced under the house it would cost around $25,000.",9/11/2020,1,0,0,0,,,,0

I was grateful for the recommendation given the unbelievably sad lack of quality professionals in the OKC plumbing and HVAC industries today. Nobody wants to get dirty, or wet. They want the result of the problem, the water in this case, cleaned up before they will get in a crawl space under the house to diagnose or fix the issue. This is Oklahoma, where quality built homes last a long time and require repairs over time just like the new ones, although the repairs are somewhat different. They want to deal with nice new homes that don't require the type of good old American work ethic that made this country what it is.Sadly, Mr. Comfort, whose marketing says ""He won't ever let you down"" didn't even make it out of the gate before letting me down. I spoke with Tim who told me he wasn't going to have his guys get under the house if there is even two inches of water, TWO INCHES!!! What does that have to do with anything, YOU'RE A PLUMBER??? I asked him exactly how was I going to do that without calling a plumber? He literally didn't even respond. PATHETIC!!!With that being said, I don't have any experience with Drabek & Hill, but I think they should definitely have a talk with their ugly sister about her lazy attitude!!!

They said that they fixed it, and in a way they did, but they kinda did a crap job of it. I only discovered that the fix didn't take after my sprinkler system was turned back on after the winter, and my lawn turned into a soupy bog (as well as getting hit with a ridiculous water bill in the process). So I needed to find a cost-effective solution to the problem. This is the third of three irrigation companies I dealt with to that end.[] Irrigation Company No. 3 []After realizing that 405 Irrigation was not going to be able to fix my broken sprinkler line for several weeks, I knew I had to keep searching. So I went on Yelp (again) and came across... some company. I don't remember what they're called now. And I called them to ask them for pricing. The lady who spoke to me on the phone informed me that they don't do irrigation system repairs anymore, but contract the work out to Quality Irrigation. So I contacted Quality Irrigation. And the dude, whose name I forget, so henceforth he shall be called Quality Dude (QD) responded pretty quickly. The pricing was reasonable enough, I guess? $85 for the first hour (which is cheaper than most others I came across), and $125 or something for the second hour (which is much more expensive than most others I came across). But there was no two hour minimum, so I ultimately made the decision to have the QD come fix the broken sprinkler line, because he said that he didn't expect to have to take more than an hour. He got it done in 55 minutes. Granted, he had a friend, and it probably would have taken longer if it wasn't for said friend, but the work being finished in under an hour meant that I had to pay $85 plus parts or whatever. Which, I feel like the parts were a tad on the expensive side, but it ended up being only $109 (total), which was notably cheaper than the other quotes I had gotten, so whatever, I'll take it, QD, I'll take it.QD was friendly. He's young (like, younger than me, which is weird, but weird in that I can't wrap my head around how everyone born on September 11, 2001 is now an ""adult""), but he seemed pretty knowledgeable. He showed me what caused the leak and why it happened. And as I previously mentioned, he worked quickly. Also, no leaks anymore. QD checked his work by checking the water meter. I have checked it myself a couple more times since then (and it's been almost two months now) just to make sure that the fix held. And it has. No leak. No ruined lawn. No insanely expensive water bill (as the result of an unintentional event, at least). Quality Dude did a quality job, and he did it for less than everyone else I had asked. And for that, I'm grateful.[] Summary []Quality Irrigation seems to live up to its name.",7/18/2020,0,2,0,1,,,,0

Recently I requested a service appointment through America Home Shield.  On 17 Nov 20, they sent out a plumber from a company called Plumb Genius.  The technician's name was Jareed.  Upon arriving, the technician assessed and informed us that the leaks were missing parts, and it would be a $165 additional charge, and he was prepared to accept that payment over the phone.  I asked what the exact amount was for and he informed me it was to rebuild the plumbing and replace missing parts and labor.   I requested a statement work of work and a detailed invoice to ensure I could not be overcharged and support his quote.  Jareed informed me that his company charges a flat fee and would not provide a statement of work nor a detailed invoice. Also, he went on tell me that AHS only pays for the diagnosis. I immediately told him to cease any work, and that I would contact my home warranty provider to express my concerns.  When we called Jareed, he informed us that he spoke with the home warranty company and resolved it.  Shortly after, we received notice from AHS that the plumber filed a claim, and we would still have to come out of pocket $165.We informed the home warranty company.  They were no missing part, and no rebuild was done, and in fact, the plumber merely replaced some washers.  Even the home warranty company was unable to tell us what added up the $165.  So apparently, Jareed filed false information in the claim to American Home Shield. Sadly, we cannot have an honest contractor doing honest work.  I can tell you to avoid those five ratings on the Plumb Genius google reviews.

I then called first thing Sunday morning to see how quick someone could come out to help me with my water heater. Their answer machine specIfically said if I had a home warranty they would call back the next business day. So because I have a home warranty I get pushed back. So Monday afternoon Danny comes and looks at my water heater and instantly says yes you need one and talked to me like I knew codes and what was required. I said I know absolutely nothing about any of it. He said well water heaters and bigger now so you need a wider opening. He also said it would look nice if I redId the closer it was in. So since he said they didn't do that stuff  I paid someone else to come out and do the 22"" widening. They come back the next day with a different service person Jerred, he then says they can't install because I didn't do what DannY said. I was extremely upset, he apologized and explained why. So he said for another 250$ I could have a skinny  tank put it. I was desperate... I haven't had hot water since Saturday and have a child.. it would  also cost me more to have someone come out to make more adjustments to the closet. So 900$ later and a 6 hour install later (with a warranty) I have water. I also paid over 100$ for an inspection that I was told would be set up the next day. I never got a call... it's been over 2 days. It really sucks this is the only company I have to chose since I have the warranty.

Recently I requested a service appointment through America Home Shield.  On 17 Nov 20, they sent out a plumber from a company called Plumb Genius.  The technician's name was Jareed.  Upon arriving, the technician assessed and informed us that the leaks were missing parts, and it would be a $165 additional charge, and he was prepared to accept that payment over the phone.  I asked what the exact amount was for and he informed me it was to rebuild the plumbing and replace missing parts and labor.   I requested a statement work of work and a detailed invoice to ensure I could not be overcharged and support his quote.  Jareed informed me that his company charges a flat fee and would not provide a statement of work nor a detailed invoice. Also, he went on tell me that AHS only pays for the diagnosis. I immediately told him to cease any work, and that I would contact my home warranty provider to express my concerns.  When we called Jareed, he informed us that he spoke with the home warranty company and resolved it.  Shortly after, we received notice from AHS that the plumber filed a claim, and we would still have to come out of pocket $165.We informed the home warranty company.  They were no missing part, and no rebuild was done, and in fact, the plumber merely replaced some washers.  Even the home warranty company was unable to tell us what added up the $165.  So apparently, Jareed filed false information in the claim to American Home Shield. Sadly, we cannot have an honest contractor doing honest work.  I can tell you to avoid those five ratings on the Plumb Genius google reviews. This company is dishonest and only looking to cheat their customers.",11/19/2020,1,0,0,0,,,,0

I then called first thing Sunday morning to see how quick someone could come out to help me with my water heater. Their answer machine specIfically said if I had a home warranty they would call back the next business day. So because I have a home warranty I get pushed back. So Monday afternoon Danny comes and looks at my water heater and instantly says yes you need one and talked to me like I knew codes and what was required. I said I know absolutely nothing about any of it. He said well water heaters and bigger now so you need a wider opening. He also said it would look nice if I redId the closer it was in. So since he said they didn't do that stuff  I paid someone else to come out and do the 22"" widening. They come back the next day with a different service person Jerred, he then says they can't install because I didn't do what DannY said. I was extremely upset, he apologized and explained why. So he said for another 250$ I could have a skinny  tank put it. I was desperate... I haven't had hot water since Saturday and have a child.. it would  also cost me more to have someone come out to make more adjustments to the closet. So 900$ later and a 6 hour install later (with a warranty) I have water. I also paid over 100$ for an inspection that I was told would be set up the next day. I never got a call... it's been over 2 days. It really sucks this is the only company I have to chose since I have the warranty. I had a friend who just had one places and needed code upgrades as well and it cost him the same without  a warranty. Guess I'll be  canceling my warranty It's now 5/19/2020 I am still waiting on my permit. The company told me they were on hold because the city quit going into homes.

A tech came out to check on the sound of running water in our home, which my husband was pretty sure was a leaking pip somewhere in our walls. Tech claimed that the running water was coming from our toilet. I told him it wasn't, my husband had already checked and had asked him to check for a leak elsewhere. He refused, stating that ""he knew"" it was the toilet. He fiddled with it some & claims to have stopped the sound we were hearing. He also checked out hot water heater (we had no hot water), and said ""someone just turned it down"". I informed him that wasnt the case, as no one had touched it and we had hot water days before. He told me I was wrong & left. Sound continued, and despite him ""turning up the hot water"", it was still out. Also, where he had fiddled with our toilet, was now broken. A piece of the inside of the toilet broke off & would not work. When we brought this up with the company they claimed he had not done anything to the toilet and they refused to fix. Meanwhile, Warranty company sent him out again and had him do a leak locate, where he found a leak (surprise, surprise). They quoted us a super inflated price, so we went with another company that charged us half of that. Additionally, when the new company came in, they did a 2nd leak locate & found that the plumb genius guy had ""located the leak"" in a place where there was no leak. Months after this, we had an issue with our tenant's water heater. Warranty company assigned us to Plumb Genius again. When they called I informed them we would be asking for another company due to our previous experience with them, and not to worry about our issue, we would call the warranty company back.

Now I will tell you why. I would consider myself a informed shopper. Before I spend thousands of dollars, I usually get several estimates to help me make an informed decision about who I will give my money to in exchange for a provided service. This good ole boy that I spoke with responded within 30 minutes of my online request. He called several times, well after normal working hours, which I didn't mind at all. When I finally returned the call (after 9 pm) I told him that I was wanting an estimate of replacing a WORKING water tank. He seemed interested, honest and professional (in the short conversation we had that night) and stated that before he could quote me an estimate, he would have to call (Locke Supply) and get his cost for the size tank I was needing. He called me back the next morning (Saturday) with the cost of the tank and an APPROXIMATE of the cost for service. We I asked for a WRITTEN and ITEMIZED estimate, he asked, ""why do I need that""? I responded, ""what kind of question is that?"" I even suggested that he come out and view/inspect the job. He responded, ""I don't want to come out and waste my time if you're not gonna do it"". I then abruptly thanked him for calling and said have a nice day. Based on this guy asking why I would need a written estimate, I quickly realized that this isn't someone or type of company I would give my money to. Buyers beware! If you're wanting a LEGITIMATE Estimate, look elsewhere. Dr. Derrick",8/17/2019,0,0,0,0,,,,0

With my home not being livable we stressed to them how urgent it was to get the job done. plumbing is expensive in general and their tech Daniel said if we dug up the hole he would write up a smaller estimate. In the meantime Cindy got us financed through their bank. We dug up the hole and scheduled an appointment for him to come out and Cindy their scheduling person stated Daniel called and no one answered but we never had a missed call. We rescheduled the appointment for the following day and he didn't show up so I called the office and Cindy said to call him directly because he wasn't answering her calls but he is to go to my property that day to write up another estimate. I called him and couldn't get an answer so we waited for him another hour and he never showed. I called Cindy the following morning and she said he didn't show up because he wasn't going to do the job for us. I asked her if he didn't do that kind of plumbing and she said no he does but he doesn't want to and she didn't know why. She said she would have the owner call me so I could be taken care of and I said ok. She ended up calling me a few hours later stating that Daniel spoke to the owner and she didn't know what he told the owner but the owner advised that we needed to look for another plumber because they will not do the job. I told Cindy to please have the owner call me for an explanation because they ran my credit and had us wait on them when they were never even interested. I never head back from the owner by the way. I felt we were being discriminated because they had no motive. They made us wait on them and in the meantime my baby and I had to relocate thinking they would help us soon. I never write negative reviews despite my negative experiences but this one draws the line. I'd hate for someone else to go through this by attempting to use Baileys Brothers services.

He seemed nice enough and didn't do a lot of talking but went right to his work, which I liked.  So, I called him again to come out to the property and look at my whirlpool tub in the master as the side wall was slipping apart from the actual part of the tub; decorative primarily but useful as I didn't want to see the plumbing fixtures daily w/o that wall being there. He came out to look at that, fixed it I thought and said if you continue to have problems, call me again as I warranty my work and I'll fix it.

Thank you for being so willing to work with us last-minute and price match!!! When I texted JOHN from First Time Heating and Air (or second opinion if you are a warranty customer), he mentioned he ""forgot to tell me"" that the furnace he ordered for our home was 80% efficiency.  We were VERY CLEAR we wanted a 95% efficiency furnace, so I told him we wanted to cancel EVERYTHING until we could do more research.   He confirmed he would cancel it all and refund our money. One more thing to note - we cancelled within 9 hours of ordering. SAME DAY. We decided to get a furnace from Advanced Air Specialists, and they were WONDERFUL to work with. 1.5 weeks after, I checked on my refund from First Time ($1500 of what I put down) and there was none.  I called the company.  Apparently JOHN told the office manager that we didn't cancel; we were just ""holding on"".  a week later I had $1000 back.  I called 5 separate times about the remaining $500... no call backs from the office.  finally I WENT THERE IN PERSON to inquire and they decided to refund $250 and keep the other $250, since they were stuck with a restocking fee.

When I insisted that the heat/ air unit be inspected by the OKC code inspector, Second Opinion keep putting me off. By calling OKC Developmental dept.

Rubber bulbs used to test the integrity of pipes were left in the pipes causing clogged lines.  The owner is a blustering blowhard who ordered his people not to show up for a scheduled appointment on a Friday afternoon, thus intentionally ensuring that I would not be able to get a real plumber out during normal (cheaper) business hours. He is incapable of a rational discussion if it involves fixing Innovative's shoddy work and resorts instead to shouting his customer down without listening. The company that fixed this mess that Innovative created has been in business for many years and tells me that Innovative's work was the worst they have ever seen.",7/19/2018Updated review,0,0,0,0,,,,0

0,"Plumber Piedmont, Ok Plumbing & Repair Contractor","Piedmont, OK 73078",1,1,,9:00 AM - 5:00 PM,Claimed,Dina F.,75,10,1,No,0,1,"I had just moved into a new house that had been inspected with everything working properly.  On move in day, I noticed the water was not getting hot.  I could not get the pilot light lit.  I called the gas company and verified that the gas was on at my address.  I called Piedmont Plumbing and after a service call, he determined I needed a new hot water heater.  My house was only 2 years old and I thought this was odd but I was desperate and agreed to it.  When he arrived to install the hot water heater, he did not have all the parts he needed or a hose to drain the existing tank.  He had to go back home to get a hose and I went to Home Depot to get the needed parts.  What plumber is this unprepared?  I should have stopped right there but I didn't.  So, he installs the new hot water tank and still no gas.  Only after he couldn't get the brand new one lit did he go check the meter and realized it was ""locked"".  He tells me that he can turn it on to test it but he will have to turn it back off and I will need to call the gas company to have it turned back on.  At this point, I really begin questioning if the other hot water tank was really broken (by now I highly suspect I had been taken).  He tells me he can show me the part that was broken.  After going back outside and spending a couple of minutes out there before coming back inside, he then shows me a part that I suspect he broke while I was waiting patiently inside.  So, he ended up getting paid for the installation of a brand new hot water heater, plus he kept my old one which there was absolutely nothing wrong with and he can install in someone else's house and make money off of it.  When I called the gas company, they informed me they had turned the gas off at the wrong address (should have been Terrace and I was Street), so there was nothing wrong with my tank!  Very dishonest!  I even told him I didn't believe there was anything wrong with my tank once he figured out the gas was off.  He proclaims to be a Christian man but he is a crook.  I would not recommend him and would advise people to stay away and go find an honest, knowledgeable and prepared licensed plumber!",10/7/2019,First,0,0,0,,,,0
