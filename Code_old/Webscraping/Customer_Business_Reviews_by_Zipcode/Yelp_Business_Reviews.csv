I got an estimate for a water heater tank that was substantially lower than a local competitor and for a larger tank.Several years ago Roto Rooter quoted me $2000 to jack hammer out my bathroom floor to remove T- drain because it was backed up & said there was NoWay to ever unclog it now. A friend told me about Wiggy's - they unclogged the drain , told me to use Thrift periodically to keep it open & charged me $75! I nearly started crying in gratitude!Need I say more? Oh yeah, there are still honest businesses around!",8/18/2017,0,3,0,0,Null,Null,Null,0
